# @xeokit

#### Welcome to the xeokit SDK - a flexible and powerful tool for creating stunning visualizations of AECO models in your browser. 

Built with TypeScript, xeokit offers lightning-fast loading and rendering of even the most complex models, while using minimal 
system resources. 

The scene graph works seamlessly on both browser and NodeJS platforms, allowing you to create, convert and 
provide content for the model viewer. 

Benefit from built-in support for multiple canvases, utility libraries with complete 
documentation, and the ability to import/export models as industry-standard AECO file formats. Collaborate with other BIM software 
via BCF Viewpoints and bring your AECO models to life with xeokit.
