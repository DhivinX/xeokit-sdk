Shaders are typically used to create effects like lighting, shadowing, texturing, and colorization.</p><p>Shaders are written in a specialized programming language that is designed to run on a graphics processing unit (GPU) rather than a central processing unit (CPU). This allows the GPU to perform highly parallelized computations that are required for real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes.</p><p>There are several types of shaders, including vertex shaders, pixel shaders, geometry shaders, and compute shaders. Vertex shaders operate on the vertices of a 3D object, pixel shaders define the color and texture of each pixel, geometry shaders modify the geometry of 3D objects, and compute shaders are used for general-purpose computations on the GPU.</p><br><h2 id="solid" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solid"><span>SOLID</span></a></h2><p><strong>SOLID</strong> is an acronym for the set of principles that we follow in the design of the xeokit SDK, in order to create maintainable and scalable code. The five principles of SOLID are:</p><ol><li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong>: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or job.</li><li><strong>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</strong>: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without changing the existing code.</li><li><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</strong>: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a class is derived from another class, it should be able to be used in the same way as the base class without any unexpected behavior.</li><li><strong>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</strong>: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that interfaces should be as small and specific as possible, so that clients only need to implement the methods they actually use.</li><li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</strong>: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This means that you should use interfaces or abstract classes to decouple the implementation details from the higher-level code.</li></ol><p>These principles are considered best practices in software development, and following them can result in code that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale over time.</p><br><h2 id="strongly-typed-events" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#strongly-typed-events"><span>Strongly Typed Events</span></a></h2><p><strong>Strongly typed events</strong> in TypeScript refer to an approach of defining and handling events in a way that leverages the language&#39;s type system to ensure type safety and better code maintainability. In this approach, events are defined as classes with specific properties and methods, and event handlers are defined as functions that take the event object as an argument. By using this approach, developers can ensure that event handlers receive the correct event object with the appropriate properties and types, and they can also easily add, remove, or modify event handlers. Additionally, this approach allows for better code documentation and IntelliSense support in code editors.</p><br><hr><h1 id="v" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#v"><span>V</span></a></h1><hr><br><h2 id="viewer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#viewer"><span>Viewer</span></a></h2>',19),ft={href:"https://xeokit.github.io/sdk/docs/modules/_xeokit_viewer.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_t=e("strong",null,"Viewer",-1),kt=o("<p>In the AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations) industries, the Viewer can be used in a variety of ways to help streamline workflows, improve communication, and facilitate collaboration.
